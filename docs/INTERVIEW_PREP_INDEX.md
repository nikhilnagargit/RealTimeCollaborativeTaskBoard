## 🎬 Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Let me show you the application. This is a task management board with three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done."

### Core Features (2 minutes)
1. **Create:** "I can create a new task with title, description, priority, and assignee."
2. **Drag-Drop:** "I can drag tasks between columns and reorder them. Notice the blue indicator showing where it will drop."
3. **Undo/Redo:** "I can undo and redo actions with Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Shift+Z."
4. **Filter:** "I can search for tasks and filter by assignee or priority."
5. **Dark Mode:** "The app supports dark mode."

### Technical Highlight (1 minute)
"The interesting part is the drag-and-drop uses fractional ordering, so inserting a task between positions 1 and 2 gives it order 1.5. This means O(1) insertion without reordering all tasks."

### Performance (30 seconds)
"I can toggle virtualization to handle 100,000+ tasks. With virtualization, it only renders about 20 visible items, maintaining 60 FPS regardless of list size."

---

## 💬 Sample Answers

### "Tell me about your project"
"I built a production-ready task management application using React 18 and TypeScript. The key challenge was performance - I implemented custom virtualization to handle 100,000+ tasks at 60 FPS. The app features drag-and-drop with a fractional ordering algorithm, a complete undo/redo system with history tracking, advanced filtering with debounced search, and full accessibility with keyboard navigation. It's deployed as a PWA with offline support and is live on Vercel."

### "What was your biggest challenge?"
"The most challenging bug was a CSS stacking context issue. Dropdowns were hidden behind task columns even with z-index 99999. After debugging with Chrome DevTools, I discovered the parent container had z-index: 0, which created a new stacking context that trapped the dropdowns. The solution was simple - remove the z-index from the parent - but the learning was valuable. I now understand that z-index only works within the same stacking context, and positioned elements with z-index create new contexts."

### "How did you optimize performance?"
"I used a multi-layered approach. First, custom virtualization - only rendering visible items gives constant O(1) time. Second, React.memo on TaskCard reduced re-renders by 70%. Third, useMemo for expensive computations like filtering and grouping. Fourth, useCallback for stable function references. Fifth, debouncing search by 300ms. The result: 100 tasks render in 12ms, 100,000 tasks in 22ms - constant time regardless of size."
